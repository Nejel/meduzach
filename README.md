# Meduzach

Meduzach is a telegram bot for [Meduza](https://meduza.io) chats. It currently supports subscribing to a number of chats and gertting updates in the real time.

It is at an early development stage.

The bot is hosted as [@MeduzachBot](https://telegram.me/meduzachbot)

## Development

The project requires python3.4+. Call `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install required libraries. Call `nosetests` for unit tests (currently broken).
